      The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the
      poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she
      rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just
      now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying
      quite still and trying to purr&mdash;no doubt feeling that it was all
      meant for its good.

      One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with
      it:&mdash;it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten
      had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an
      hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it
      COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.
